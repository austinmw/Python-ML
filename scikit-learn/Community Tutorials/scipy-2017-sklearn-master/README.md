This repository will contain the teaching material and other info associated with our scikit-learn tutorial
at [SciPy 2017](http://scipy2017.scipy.org/) held July 10-16 in Austin, Texas.

Parts 1 to 5 make up the morning session, while
parts 6 to 9 will be presented in the afternoon.

### Schedule:

The 2-part tutorial will be held on Tuesday, July 11, 2017.

- Parts 1 to 5: 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM (Room 203)
- Parts 6 to 9: 1:30 PM - 5:30 PM (Room 203)



Obtaining the Tutorial Material
------------------


If you have a GitHub account, it is probably most convenient if you fork the
GitHub repository. If you don’t have an GitHub account, you can download the
repository as a .zip file by heading over to the GitHub repository
(https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2016-sklearn) in your browser and click the
green “Download” button in the upper right.

Please note that we may add and improve the material until shortly before the
tutorial session, and we recommend you to update your copy of the materials one
day before the tutorials. If you have an GitHub account and forked/cloned the
repository via GitHub, you can sync your existing fork with via the following
commands:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2017-sklearn.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout master merge upstream/master
```

If you don’t have a GitHub account, you may have to re-download the .zip archive from GitHub.


Installation Notes
------------------

This tutorial will require recent installations of

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)
- [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
- [pillow](https://python-pillow.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [IPython](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)


The last one is important, you should be able to type:

    jupyter notebook

in your terminal window and see the notebook panel load in your web browser.
Try opening and running a notebook from the material to see check that it works.

For users who do not yet have these  packages installed, a relatively
painless way to install all the requirements is to use a Python distribution
such as [Anaconda CE](http://store.continuum.io/ "Anaconda CE"), which includes
the most relevant Python packages for science, math, engineering, and
data analysis; Anaconda can be downloaded and installed for free
including commercial use and redistribution.
The code examples in this tutorial should be compatible to Python 2.7,
Python 3.4-3.6.

For some of the plots in the tutorial, you will also need the graphviz library.
If you are using Anaconda or conda, you can install it via
```bash
conda install graphviz python-graphviz
```

If you do not use conda, you need to install graphviz via your package manager
(brew, apt, ...) and install the python graphviz library via
```bash
pip install graphviz
``

After obtaining the material, we **strongly recommend** you to open and execute
the Jupyter Notebook `jupter notebook check_env.ipynb` that is located at the
top level of this repository. Inside the repository, you can open the notebook
by executing

```bash
jupyter notebook check_env.ipynb
```

inside this repository. Inside the Notebook, you can run the code cell by
clicking on the "Run Cells" button as illustrated in the figure below:

Finally, if your environment satisfies the requirements for the tutorials, the
executed code cell will produce an output message as shown below:

![](images/check_env-2.png)

Although not required, we also recommend you to update the required Python
packages to their latest versions to ensure best compatibility with the
teaching material. Please upgrade already installed packages by executing

- `pip install [package-name] --upgrade`  
- or `conda update [package-name]`



Data Downloads
--------------

The data for this tutorial is not included in the repository.  We will be
using several data sets during the tutorial: most are built-in to
scikit-learn, which
includes code that automatically downloads and caches these
data.

**Because the wireless network
at conferences can often be spotty, it would be a good idea to download these
data sets before arriving at the conference.
Please run ``python fetch_data.py`` to download all necessary data beforehand.**

The download size of the data files are approx. 280 MB, and after `fetch_data.py`
extracted the data on your disk, the ./notebook/dataset folder will take 480 MB
of your local solid state or hard drive.
