# Which book version/format would you recommend?

Personally, I prefer Amazon when it comes to print versions of books (probably because they ship pretty quickly). For ebooks, I really have no preference: Google books, Amazon, or iBooks -- they come all with pretty good reading apps for your tablet or computer.

I really do not want to advertise any platform here, but I think it would not be a bad idea to consider getting it from the publisher directly, since you'd get a DRM-free .epub version for your favorite reading app plus the PDF. And adding the print version is only slightly more expensive. Unfortunately, the figures in the print version will be in grayscale, so it's probably nicer to take a look at the digital options.

But no matter which platform you choose: I will make sure that you get the code examples most conveniently -- I will upload them here on GitHub; you won't need to create an account at PACKT just to download the code examples :).
