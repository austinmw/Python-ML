# Where are the best online communities centered around data science/machine learning or python?

I think [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rasbt) is great to stay in touch and see what other people are up to, and to share news of course. [Cross-validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com) & [Quora](https://www.quora.com/topic/Machine-Learning) are good websites to ask specific questions and collect multiple opinions about a topic. There's also a [machine learning group on Google+](https://plus.google.com/communities/107785538899595981479) that has a lot of members, but is not that active anymore I fear. The [MachineLearning subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/) is another nice place to discuss certain news and articles.
