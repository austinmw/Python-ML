# What are some good books/papers for learning deep learning?


A good overview and introduction is the recent deep learning review published in Nature (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/full/nature14539.html); it references a lot of useful literature to follow up on

- LeCun, Yann, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton. "Deep learning." Nature521.7553 (2015): 436-444.


As a good textbook resource, I would like to recommend Yoshua Bengio's upcoming "Deep Learning" book. The book is freely accessible at: http://goodfeli.github.io/dlbook/

- Bengio, Yoshua, Ian Goodfellow, and Aaron Courville. "Deep learning." An MIT Press book in preparation. Draft chapters available at http://www. iro. umontreal. ca/âˆ¼ bengioy/dlbook (2014).
